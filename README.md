# NumberMumble
a number station emulator for arduino 

Done with the Mozzi Library: https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/

If you want your own numbers on it Export the audio to signed 8-bit in raw to later on convert using char2mozzi.py (https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/char2mozzi_8py_source.html). This will turn your sample into a wavetable that the arduino program can handle. Ensure you have python installed with all the options selected to work in comand prompt enviroment.

Attention! The audio samples must be always stored on the generic sample folder inside the mozzi library folder to work good or define your own folder route on the code.
